Version control is a system that allows you to manage and track changes to files in a project over time. It allows multiple people to collaborate on the same project, keeps a history of changes, and enables you to revert to previous versions of the project if needed.

Git is a version control system that allows you to track changes to files and coordinate work on those files among multiple people.

Git fetch contacts the remote repository and retrieves any changes that have been made since your last fetch or clone. However, it does not automatically merge or update your working directory or local branches.
                                                                      while
Git pull fetches the changes from the remote repository and then automatically tries to merge those changes into your current branch.

Git rebase is a way to reapply your changes on top of another branch, the command for it is git rebase main.

It allows you to pick individual commits from one branch and apply them to another branch, the command for it is git cherry-pick <commit-hash> (<commit-hash> is the ID of the commit you want to apply to your current branch).
